## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### **Login Process:**
1. User enters email/password (or uses demo credentials)
2. Frontend validates inputs
3. POST `/auth/login` with credentials
4. Backend validates and returns JWT token + user data
5. Store token in localStorage
6. If Remember Me checked, store preference
7. Show welcome toast with user name
8. Redirect based on role:
   - Farmer → `/farmer`
   - Consumer → `/consumer`
   - Admin → `/admin`

### **Register Process:**
1. User selects role (visual cards)
2. Fills form with validation:
   - Email validation (regex)
   - Password strength (min 6 chars)
   - Confirm password matching
   - City selection
   - Mandi (for farmers only)
3. POST `/auth/register` with form data
4. Backend creates user account
5. Auto-login or redirect to login
6. Show success message

### **Protected Routes:**
- All API calls include JWT token in Authorization header
- Backend middleware verifies token
- Invalid/expired tokens return 401
- Frontend redirects to login on 401
