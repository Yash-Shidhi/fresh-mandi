## 📊 Rating Calculation

**Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Triggered on: Create, Update, Delete review
async function updateProductRating(productId) {
  const reviews = await Review.find({ productId })
  const reviewCount = reviews.length
  const averageRating = reviewCount > 0 
    ? reviews.reduce((sum, review) => sum + review.rating, 0) / reviewCount 
    : 0
  
  await Product.findByIdAndUpdate(productId, {
    averageRating: Math.round(averageRating * 10) / 10, // Round to 1 decimal
    reviewCount
  })
}
```

**Example:**
- Review 1: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars)
- Review 2: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars)
- Review 3: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars)

Average = (5 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 4.7 ⭐
